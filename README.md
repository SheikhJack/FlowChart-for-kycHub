Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for KYC Hub API Integration
This repository contains a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) that illustrates the integration of the KYC Hub API for verification processes. The diagram provides a clear view of the system's components, processes, data stores, and interactions between entities.

Overview
The KYC Hub API is utilized for performing identity verification, compliance checks, and fraud prevention. This DFD explains how data flows within the system, specifically for an example application like BetWay that requires KYC for its users.

Purpose
To provide a high-level overview of the KYC Hub API integration.
To visualize user data flow from submission to verification.
To ensure the process adheres to security and compliance standards.
Components in the DFD
Entities

User: The person interacting with the system who submits documents for verification.
Admin: The internal staff managing verification reports and actions.
Processes

Submit Verification Request: The user uploads their documents.
API Call to KYC Hub: The system sends the documents to the KYC Hub for verification.
Receive Verification Results: The KYC Hub responds with verification status and reports.
Manual Review: If necessary, an admin reviews the reports.
Data Stores

User Data Store: Stores user-provided information such as documents and personal details.
Verification Logs: Maintains the history of verification requests and responses.
Data Flows

Data flows between users, processes, and data stores to ensure seamless integration and interaction with the API.
